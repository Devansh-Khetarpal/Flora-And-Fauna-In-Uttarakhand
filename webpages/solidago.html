          Solidago, commonly called goldenrods, is a genus of about 
          100 to 120 species of flowering plants in the family 
          Asteraceae. Most are herbaceous perennial species found 
          in open areas such as meadows, prairies, and savannas. 
          They are mostly native to North America, including Mexico; 
          a few species are native to South America and Eurasia.
           Some American species have also been introduced into 
           Europe and other parts of the world.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          Solidago species are perennials growing from woody 
          caudices or rhizomes. Their stems range from decumbent 
          (crawling) to ascending or erect, with a range of heights
           going from 5 cm (2.0 in) to over a meter. Most 
           species are unbranched, but some do display branching 
           in the upper part of the plant. Both leaves and stems 
           vary from glabrous (hairless) to various forms of pubescence
            (strigose, strigillose, hispid, stipitate-glandular or 
            villous). In some species, the basal leaves are shed 
            before flowering. The leaf margins are most commonly
             entire, but often display heavier serration. 
             Some leaves may display trinerved venation rather 
             than the pinnate venation usual across Asteraceae.
             The flower is also the state flower of Kentucky.
