          The name came into popular use in the late Victorian
           era along with other flower names. Linda Rosenkrantz 
           and Pamela Redmond Satran wrote in their 2007 book 
           Baby Name Bible that Daisy has a "fresh, wholesome, 
           and energetic" image.[2] The name has been used for
            literary characters such as Daisy Miller, the title 
            character of the novella by Henry James. 
            In Louisa May Alcott's Little Women, a character 
            named Margaret is "Meg" to her family, but "Daisy" 
            to her wealthy would-be-friends. In television, 
            Daisy Duke on The Dukes of Hazzard wears very short, 
            form-fitting, denim cut-off jeans shorts, now often 
            called Daisy Dukes after this character.

          The name was in steady use for American girls 
          throughout the 20th century and was ranked among
           the top 200 names for girls between 1900 and 1940. 
           It declined in popularity between 1960 and 1980, 
           but has been climbing in popularity since the 1980s 
           and has again ranked among the top 200 names for 
           American girls since 1990. It was the 294th most 
           common name for all females during the 1990 United
            States census. Daisy has ranked among the top 100 
            names for girls in the United Kingdom since 1996 
            and in the past decade in Australia, Ireland, 
            and New Zealand.

          The flowers are typically pale yellow, though white
           or pink forms are often seen in nature. The flowers
            are actinomorphic with a superior ovary which later 
            forms a capsule opening by valves to release the 
            small black seeds. The flowers are hermaphrodite
             but heterostylous; individual plants bear either
              pin flowers (longuistylous flower: with the capita
               of the style prominent) or thrum flowers 
               (brevistylous flower: with the stamens prominent). 
               Fertilisation can only take place between pin and 
               thrum flowers. Pin-to-pin and thrum-to-thrum
                pollination is ineffective.
