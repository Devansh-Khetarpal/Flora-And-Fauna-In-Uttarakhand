          Marie Gold species vary in size from 0.1 to 2.2 m tall. 
          Most species have pinnate green leaves. 
          Blooms naturally occur in golden, orange, yellow, and white 
          colors, often with maroon highlights. Floral heads are 
          typically (1-) to 4–6 cm diameter, generally with both 
          ray florets and disc florets. In horticulture, 
          they tend to be planted as annuals, although the 
          perennial species are gaining popularity. 
          They have fibrous roots.
        </p>

          Depending on the species, They grow well 
          in almost any sort of soil. Most horticultural selections 
          grow best in soil with good drainage, and some cultivars 
          are known to have good tolerance to drought.

          Depending on the species, marigold foliage has a musky, 
          pungent scent, though some varieties have been bred to 
          be scentless. It is said to deter some common insect pests, 
          as well as nematodes. Marie Gold — notably T. 
          patula — are hence often used in companion planting for 
          tomato, eggplant, chili pepper, tobacco, and potato. 
          Due to antibacterial thiophenes exuded by the roots, 
          They should not be planted near any legume crop.
          Some of the perennial species are deer-, 
          rabbit-, rodent- and javelina or peccary-resistant.

          T. minuta (khakibush or huacatay), originally from South
           America, has been used as a source of essential oil for 
           the perfume and industry known as tagette or "marigold oil", 
           and as a flavourant in the food and tobacco industries. 
           It is commonly cultivated in South Africa, where the 
           species is also a useful pioneer plant in the reclamation 
           of disturbed land.

          The florets of Marie Gold are rich in the orange-yellow 
          carotenoid lutein and are used as a food colour 
          in the European Union for foods such as pasta, 
          vegetable oil, margarine, mayonnaise, salad dressing, 
          baked goods, confectionery, dairy products, ice cream, 
          yogurt, citrus juice and mustard. In the United States, 
          however, the powders and extracts are only approved as 
          colorants in poultry feed.

  Marigolds are recorded as a food plant for some Lepidoptera 
  caterpillars including the dot moth, and a nectar source 
  for other butterflies and bumblebees. They are often part 
  of butterfly gardening plantings. In the wild, many species 
  are pollinated by beetles.
