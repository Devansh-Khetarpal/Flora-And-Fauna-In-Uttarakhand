          Lilium is a genus of herbaceous flowering plants 
          growing from bulbs, all with large prominent flowers. 
          They are the true lilies. Lilies are a group of flowering 
          plants which are important in culture and literature
           in much of the world. Most species are native to the 
           northern hemisphere and their range is temperate 
           climates and extends into the subtropics. Many other
            plants have "lily" in their common names, but do not
             belong to the same genus and are therefore not true 
             lilies.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lilies are tall perennials ranging in height from 
          2–6 ft (60–180 cm). They form naked or tunicless 
          scaly underground bulbs which are their organs 
          of perennation. In some North American species 
          the base of the bulb develops into rhizomes, 
          on which numerous small bulbs are found. Some species 
          develop stolons. Most bulbs are buried deep in the ground, 
          but a few species form bulbs near the soil surface. 
          Many species form stem-roots. With these, the bulb 
          grows naturally at some depth in the soil, and each 
          year the new stem puts out adventitious roots above 
          the bulb as it emerges from the soil. These roots are 
          in addition to the basal roots that develop at the base
           of the bulb.

          The flowers are large, often fragrant, and come in 
          a wide range of colors including whites, yellows, 
          oranges, pinks, reds and purples. Markings include 
          spots and brush strokes. The plants are late spring- 
          or summer-flowering. Flowers are borne in racemes or 
          umbels at the tip of the stem, with six tepals spreading 
          or reflexed, to give flowers varying from funnel shape to 
          a "Turk's cap". The tepals are free from each other, 
          and bear a nectary at the base of each flower. 
          The ovary is 'superior', borne above the point of 
          attachment of the anthers. The fruit is a three-celled 
          capsule.
