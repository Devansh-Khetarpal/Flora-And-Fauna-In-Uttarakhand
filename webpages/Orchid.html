        <h3>
        <p>
          Orchids are plants that belong to the family 
          Orchid is a diverse and widespread group of 
          flowering plants with blooms that are often 
          colourful and fragrant.
        </p>
        <p>
          Along with the Asteraceae, they are one of the two 
          largest families of flowering plants. 
          The Orchid have about 28,000 currently accepted species, 
          distributed in about 763 genera. The determination 
          of which family is larger is still under debate, 
          because verified data on the members of such enormous 
          families are continually in flux. Regardless, 
          the number of orchid species is nearly equal to the 
          number of bony fishes, more than twice the number of 
          bird species, and about four times the number of 
          mammal species.
        </p>
        <p>
          The family encompasses about 6â€“11% of all species of 
          seed plants. The largest genera are Bulbophyllum 
          (2,000 species), Epidendrum (1,500 species), 
          Dendrobium (1,400 species) and Pleurothallis (1,000 species). 
          It also includes Vanilla (the genus of the vanilla plant), 
          the type genus Orchid, and many commonly cultivated plants 
          such as Phalaenopsis and Cattleya. Moreover, since the 
          introduction of tropical species into cultivation in the 
          19th century, horticulturists have produced more than 100,000 
          hybrids and cultivars.
        </p>
        <p>

          Orchids are easily distinguished from other plants, 
          as they share some very evident derived characteristics 
          or synapomorphies. Among these are: bilateral symmetry of 
          the flower (zygomorphism), many resupinate flowers, 
          a nearly always highly modified petal (labellum), 
          fused stamens and carpels, and extremely small seeds.
