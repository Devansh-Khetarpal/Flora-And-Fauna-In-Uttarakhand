        <p>
          Primula vulgaris, the common primrose, is a species
           of flowering plant in the family Primulaceae, 
           native to western and southern Europe, northwest Africa, 
           and parts of southwest Asia.The common name is primrose,
            or occasionally common primrose or English primrose 
            to distinguish it from other Primula species also 
            called primroses. None of these are closely related 
            to the evening primroses.
        </p>
        <p>
          Primula vulgaris is a perennial growing 10–30 cm (4–12 in)
           tall, with a basal rosette of leaves which are more-or-less
            evergreen in favoured habitats. It flowers in early spring
             in the northern hemisphere (February–April) on slopes
              and meadows.


        </p>
        <p>
          The leaves are 5–25 cm long and 2–6 cm broad, 
          often heavily wrinkled, with an irregularly crenate
           to dentate margin. The leaf blade is gradually 
           attenuated towards the base and unevenly toothed. 
           The single stem, extremely short, is hidden in the 
           centre of the leaf rosette. The delicately scented 
           flowers are 2–4 cm in diameter, borne singly on short
            slender stems.
        </p>
        <p>

          The flowers are typically pale yellow, though white
           or pink forms are often seen in nature. The flowers
            are actinomorphic with a superior ovary which later 
            forms a capsule opening by valves to release the 
            small black seeds. The flowers are hermaphrodite
             but heterostylous; individual plants bear either
              pin flowers (longuistylous flower: with the capita
               of the style prominent) or thrum flowers 
               (brevistylous flower: with the stamens prominent). 
               Fertilisation can only take place between pin and 
               thrum flowers. Pin-to-pin and thrum-to-thrum
                pollination is ineffective.
        </p>
