          Hardy geraniums, or crane's-bill, are clump-forming
           perennials that bloom in a generous flush in late 
           spring or early summer. The five-petaled flowers 
           vary in color and size. The range includes pastel 
           pinks and blues, white, rose, and deep magenta
            sometimes accented with black centers. 
            The leaves are usually green, somewhat rounded, 
            and lobed. Plants range from a few inches to a 
            few feet tall. A few types climb or scramble onto bushes.

        <h2>How to grow:</h2>
       <h3>
        <p>
         Garden geraniums need good well-drained garden soil 
         in full sun or light shade in areas with hot summers. 
         Shear plants back for neatness after the blooms have
          all opened. You may get regrowth and a second crop of 
          flowers. Thin or divide when plants become crowded.

           Geranium cinereum is a low-growing plant usually 
           reaching about eight inches in height with one-inch 
           pink flowers. G. macrorrhizum is a vigorous species 
           with large pink flowers, lots of vigor, and thick 
           roots that are easy to transplant.
